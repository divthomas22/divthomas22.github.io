## Course and Project Experience

<h3>MIPS Partial Disassembler - Computer Architecture</h3>
<h4> February 2021 </h4>
  
<p>The <em>MIPS Partial Disassembler</em> is a C++ program which takes in an array of 32-bit machine instructions and decodes them, outputting the operations and registers corresponding to these instructions. The purpose of this project is to create a program that resembles the processes of a computer processing instructions for specific operation.<p>
